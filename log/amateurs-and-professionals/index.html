<p>Every so often I get the craving to tweak my workflow: a more comfortable shell
here, a few Vim shortcuts there, and a sprinkle of aesthetics to tie it all
together. It's a fun diversion and makes my daily work a little faster.</p>
<p>The instinctual fantasy is that the right tools and the right shortcuts will
finally rapture me to the world of Rockstardom. But the moment passes when I
remember that one of the best engineers I know uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing#Hunt_and_peck">two-finger typing</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>The author Steven Pressfield distinguishes between <em>amateurs</em> and
<em>professionals</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sign of the amateur is overglorification of and preoccupation with the
mystery.</p>
<p>The professional shuts up. She doesn’t talk about it. She does her work.</p>
<p>&mdash; Steven Pressfield, <em>The War of Art</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These terms are <strong>attitudes</strong>, not job descriptions. Even a senior Google
engineer can be an amateur, and even a hobbyist can be a
professional.</p>
<p>The amateur attitude is flash over substance. It's <em>being</em> a writer over
<em>doing</em> the writing; hacks over principles; the fantasy of big results over the
reality of daily process.</p>
<p>The professional attitude is the opposite: process, consistency, discipline,
effort, and fundamentals. It's focusing your energy on what really matters.</p>
<hr />
<p>Three examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dan Luu has one of the <a href="http://danluu.com">plainest blogs</a> I've ever seen,
enough so that Hacker News inevitably kvetches about it. (<em>"I would have tried
to read this but the 1994 styling of the page made it impossible,"</em>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29551067">e.g.</a>). But his posts are so thorough and insightful that they become
popular anyway. When substance is solid, substance wins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw a nice comment online that I wish I could find again. The gist: Elon Musk
is a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=elon+musk+bad+presenter">notoriously bad presenter</a>. But his companies are pushing the
boundaries on monstrously hard technical problems. The technology is so
captivating that his presentations are riveting despite him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> is a gorgeous editor. I don't think I've seen <em>any</em>
text editor that looks and feels better. But it's also reliable, powerful, and
stunningly fast. If it were uglier, it would still have customers. If it were
unstable, I don't know anyone who would buy it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>What are the fundamentals of software engineering? What does the professional
see that the amateur doesn't?</p>
<p>Here are some that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Make something people want.</strong> The professional deeply engages with reality.
  She finds opportunities by talking to real people and diving into the details
  of real systems. She observes, iterates, and creates something valuable that
  people love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solve the hard problem.</strong> The professional solves the hard problems that
  others avoid. She has the domain knowledge to know what the hard problems
  <em>are</em> and the technical expertise to know what she can do about them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay disciplined.</strong> The professional tames the waves of frustration,
  boredom, uncertainty, and self-doubt. She has the tenacity and focus to see
  her work through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Work as a team.</strong> The professional knows she can't do everything alone. She
  plays to her strengths, communicates clearly and openly, and works well with
  others. She builds trust and a professional culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Move fast and learn fast.</strong> The professional knows which parts of a project
  are the most fraught and optimizes her workflow accordingly. She tests her
  assumptions early and cheaply, and she avoids chasing dead ends. And if
  something just won't work, she acknowledges it and moves on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds great. But how do we translate these high-level ideas into something
concrete and actionable? I have some hunches, but it'll take more than one blog
post to work them out.</p>
<blockquote>

o’clock.</p>

</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat are two of the most outstanding engineers at
Google. Together, they've produced breakthrough projects like MapReduce,
Bigtable, and TensorFlow. Google pays them lavishly and they're worth every
penny.</p>
<p>How are they so effective?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those who work inside Google, it's well worth it to look at Jeff &amp;
Sanjay's commit history and code review dashboard. They aren't actually all
that much more productive in terms of code written than a decent SWE3 who
knows his codebase.</p>
<p>The reason they have a reputation as rockstars is that they can <em>apply</em> this
 productivity to things that really matter[.]</p>
<p>&mdash; <em>nostrademons</em> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5496406">via Hacker News</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Why is the professional attitude so rare? It's precisely <em>because</em> the
professional attitude is about fundamentals.</p>
<p>Fundamentals apply widely and deeply. They are so global that they must become
habit. They are so simple that they border on cliché. Working on them can feel
boring, effortful, and even embarrassing.</p>
<p>Hacks and tricks apply narrowly and shallowly. They are so local that we can
use them and forget them. They are complex and novel, so they easily grab our
attention. And knowing a neat trick can make us feel special and superior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]hat changed me from an amateur into a professional was getting a really
firm grip on the fundamentals.</p>
<p>&mdash; Toshiro Kageyama 7-dan, <em>Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go</em> (Japanese
title: <em>Amateurs and Professionals</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't mistake me; I think tricks are great. <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/363119">Even world-class
mathematicians</a> have favorites that they use constantly. But they are
world-class precisely <em>because</em> they have mastered their fundamentals.</p>
<hr />
<p>How can we cultivate a professional attitude? I don't know. But if it helps,
here's a tendency I've noticed in myself.</p>
<p>When I'm solving a problem I care deeply about, even the drudge work is
energizing. Then the professional spirit kicks in: I'm greedy for <em>anything</em>
that will help me attain my goal.</p>
<p>When I'm solving a problem I don't care about, even the novel parts are boring.
Then the amateur spirit kicks in: a new language, a new framework, some <em>twist</em>
to keep myself engaged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comes a day you're gonna have to decide whether it's about <em>you</em> or about the
<em>work</em>.</p>
<p>&mdash; Cedric Daniels, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNEDJPeoHZo">The Wire</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope you find something that inspires you to hold a professional attitude.
Get the substance right and the rest takes care of itself.</p>
