<blockquote>
<p>The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the
exponential function.</p>
<p>&mdash; Albert A. Bartlett</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GDP, Moore's law, greenhouse gas emissions &mdash; Exponential goods are the some of
our greatest blessings and dangers.</p>
<p>But what exponentials can a person create in their own life? <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=exponential+self+growth">Ask the
internet</a> and you'll learn that you're just one listicle away from
bench pressing Mount Everest and eating grapes from the hands of your three
million wives.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate. The giddiness of the messenger, and perhaps the confusion
of "exponential" with "fast," confuses the ordinary but profound reality.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, there are exponentials both positive (growing unboundedly)
and negative (decaying to zero) at the personal level.</p>
<p>For positives, only two come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Wealth</strong> &mdash; money, stocks, equity growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Influence</strong> &mdash; subscribers and views when directed outward; recommendations
  and opportunities when directed inward.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are straightforward but influence is more clearly zero-sum: the more my
audience engages with me, the less they engage with something else. But given
the state of attention in the modern world, I think this is an improvement.</p>
<p>There is also a third I'm less sure about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idea exploration</strong> &mdash; finding good ideas (and ignoring bad ones), either
  through honing your intuition or by being able to try ideas out exponentially
  (e.g. through your network).</li>
</ul>
<p>I put this in the exponential bucket because the wrong idea (even with good
execution) is worth nothing, but the right one is worth billions.</p>
<p>I'm reminded again of the insight about Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat I quoted
in my <a href="/log/amateurs-and-professionals/">amateurs and professionals</a> post. It's not that they type
thousands of times faster; it's that their intuition leads them to the one good
idea over the thousand bad ones.</p>
<p>And once again, this idea to be an important fundamental that cuts across
domains. To quote the Go player Toshiro Kageyama 7-dan, whom I've <a href="/log/kageyama-7-dan-on-amateurs-and-professionals">mentioned
before</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One must, without fail, learn the correct way to study.</p>
<p>&mdash; Toshiro Kageyama 7-dan, <em>Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For negative exponentials, only one comes to mind: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
repetition</a> to memorize facts
with exponentially less time. With spaced repetition our memory is bounded only
by how fast we can add facts to the system. Note that while this is a
breakthrough, our ability to memorize ultimately remains linear.</p>
<p>For all else, I think growth is mostly linear or sub-linear, with rare
multiplicitave phases. But steady growth of any kind makes us incomparable to
who we once were. It may not be exponential, but it's wonder enough.</p>
