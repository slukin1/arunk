    <h1 class="mb0">A Fast and Simple Gmail Workflow</h1>
    <p class="gray f7 normal db mt0">2022-01-07</p>
</header>
<p>I created my main Gmail account in September 2004, and since then I've made
almost 55,000 threads. That's about ten threads a day for 17 years. At times
I've managed to keep that under control. But email becomes secondary in the
high tides of life, and ten threads a day soon becomes a storm of hundreds.</p>
<p>Sometimes I've declared <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_bankruptcy">email bankruptcy</a>, but it feels like a
failure each time I do so. What opportunities have I missed because I didn't
follow up in time? And how can I expect others to reply to me if I don't do the
same for them?</p>
<p>So I've started using a simple workflow to manage my inbox, no matter how large
it might get:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with the oldest email I have.</li>
<li>If I can handle it quickly, do so. Otherwise, deal with it later.</li>
<li>Move to the next one.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's simple, but the trick is in the details. With the right shortcuts and the
right labels, I can handle hundreds of emails in one go. Email backlogs are no
longer intimidating, and I can keep my inboxes clear.</p>
<h1>The setup</h1>
<p>I use the default Gmail view and the default sort order. So my inbox is a
simple list with the newest emails first.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Update &mdash; I switched to a Multiple Inbox view and added a second view.
This view includes only emails marked with my <code>!</code> label, which I use for
important emails.</p>
</div>
<p>The critical extension is <em>Keyboard shortcuts</em> under <em>Settings &gt; General</em>. You
can type <code>?</code> at any time to see all of the available shortcuts, but four are
enough for this workflow to work:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>}</code> &mdash; archive and move to the next newest</li>
<li><code>r</code> &mdash; reply</li>
<li><code>l</code> &mdash; add a label</li>
<li><code>⌘+Enter</code> &mdash; send</li>
</ul>
<h1>The core workflow</h1>
<p>First I open the oldest email I have. If my inbox is truly massive, I <a href="https://gsuitetips.com/tips/gmail/sort-email-by-oldest-first/">sort by
oldest first</a> so I don't have to go looking for it.</p>
<p>The email is open with no distractions to pull me away. Then I decide what kind
of email I'm looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Irrelevant</strong> &mdash; Spam, irrelevant mailing lists, and emails that just aren't
  worth the time. For most mailing lists, Gmail has an <em>Unsubscribe</em> link next
  to the sender's email address. Otherwise, hit <code>}</code> to move on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No reply</strong> &mdash; For announcements or emails that are outdated. Hit <code>}</code> to
  move on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fast reply</strong> &mdash; For emails I can write within a minute or so. <code>r</code> to reply
  and <code>⌘+Enter</code> to send. Then hit <code>}</code> to move on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Slow reply</strong> &mdash; If I need more time to reply, I add a special label to the
  email so I can find and follow up on it later. I type <code>l</code> to pull up the
  label menu, enter my label name, hit <code>Enter</code>, then hit <code>}</code> to move on.</p>
<p>I use a short label name like <code>!</code> since it's faster to type. So the full
sequence is something like <code>l!&lt;enter&gt;}</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main friction here is clicking the <em>Unsubscribe</em> link. Otherwise, I can get
through the first three types here in seconds.</p>
<h1>Extending the workflow</h1>
<p>If this basic workflow works for you, here are some simple ways to extend it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Undo</strong> &mdash; Use <code>z</code> to undo an action. For example, maybe you didn't mean to
  archive the email you were looking at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spam and trash</strong> &mdash; Use <code>!</code> to mark emails as spam and <code>#</code> to send emails
  to the trash. Unfortunately this returns you to the main inbox, so I don't
  really like using it. So I usually just hit <code>}</code> to archive everything.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And if I decide this workflow needs changing, I'll post an update.</p>
