    <h1 class="mb0">Kageyama 7-Dan on Amateurs and Professionals</h1>
    <p class="gray f7 normal db mt0">2022-01-09</p>
</header>
<p>In <a href="/log/amateurs-and-professionals/">yesterday's post</a> I quoted Toshiro Kageyama 7-dan, author of the
fantastic <em>Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go</em>. If I were more self-indulgent, I
would have quoted nearly half the book.</p>
<p>But I just realized something: I have a <em>blog</em>, and I can do whatever I <em>want</em>!</p>
<p>In the quotes below, all emphasis is mine.</p>
<h1>On amateurs and professionals</h1>
<p>On the beauty of the professional's work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Watching a professional game, one can sense beauty in the flow of play and
beauty in the shapes created. Amateur go does not even begin to approach
this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simple difference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To put it simply, amateurs play at the game; professionals labor at it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making the leap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]hat changed me from an amateur into a professional was getting a really
firm grip on the fundamentals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The universal rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faithfulness to fundamentals seems to be a common thread linking
professionalism in all areas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On trusting the basics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go is the kind of game in which you are an expert if you can just keep on
making ordinary moves. You need not play any especially brilliant moves at
all. Amateurs' moves, however, are frequently far from ordinary; in fact, I
see them making the most nonsensical moves imaginable[.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like your craft; be willing to learn; and put in the effort to do it right:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No doubt the first requirement for becoming strong at go is to like it, like
it more than food or drink, and a second requirement is the desire to learn.
A third requirement is to study it, using proper methods, patiently, little
by little, without cramming. Ask dan-level amateurs and you will find that
they did not become stronger just by playing their opponents for fun. Each one
kindled the desire to learn more, and put in no small amount of time
studying.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>On fundamentals</h1>
<p>Internalizing the fundamentals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most important thing to learn from professionals is not where they play
but why they play there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fundamentals are endless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When he advances to the point where he begins to think of himself as a strong
player, the thing he needs to do to become ever stronger is to go back and
study the fundamentals once more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On making them instinctual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] the game lasts for two or three hundred moves, and you cannot stop at
each one to consider each of the fundamentals. You have to soak up the
fundamentals as you practice on your own, studying them until they become a
part of your very being. <em>If the fundamentals do not operate subconciously
when you sit down to play, you have not mastered them yet.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>On the dangers of amateurism</h1>
<p>Collapsing due to shallow, brittle knowledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Those who memorize fixed opening patterns] tend to become too dependent on
patterns, thereby crippling their innate strength, and fall easy prey to the
former, who have nothing but innate strength to rely on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the disastrous end of the amateur path. My favorite quote from the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The reason that so many people never master this elementary skill is that
they keep ignoring it as being beneath them.</em> They are the people who cannot
be bothered to 'read'; who try to capture the uncapturable group because it
just looks as if it can be done or because they figure they can muddle
through somehow, and so they rush headlong into disaster. They are also the
people who, when they face a slightly stronger opponent, do not try to
capture the capturable group because with their fuzzy reading they are afraid
of messing it up; who innocently add unnecessary stones to their already
alive groups; who take fright without cause; who tremble when they sit down
at the go board; who play through the whole game without a sullen expression;
who lose every fight; who eventually come to hate go. <em>Sorry wretches,
through choice they have abandoned the most interesting and enjoyable of all
games.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>On emotional management</h1>
<p>Avoiding despair:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who leads an abandoned and dissipated life because the end of the wold
is near is going to experience his own personal destruction first.
Desperation and despair are to be feared most of all.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>On effort</h1>
<p>Effort in everything:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a saying that a lion gives its all when chasing even a rabbit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pain of effort is worth it &mdash; but only if done right:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course one cannot make progress in any discipline without effort. 'There
is no pleasure without pain.' Pleasure is progress, and pain the pain of
effort.  Study in the wrong way, however, and the result may be just pain
with no pleasure at all. One must, without fail, learn the correct way to
study.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No professional regrets the time he has to spend studying. [...] The way
young players have taken over the game can only be called terrifying. The
time they spend studying every day defies the imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Talent is not enough:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professionals do this unquestioningly. Even a gemstone has to be polished.
'A man is always moving either forward or backward,' says Kano, 9-dan. 'He
never stands still. This should be every go player's motto, and he should
<em>keep piling effort on top of effort</em> no matter what his age. He can be
confident of always making progress.'</p>
</blockquote>
